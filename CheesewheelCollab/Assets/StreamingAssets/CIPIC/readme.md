# CIPIC HRTF Database

This repository contains the CIPIC HRTF database. This is a database of head-related transfer functions useful for implementing spatial audio, created by the Center for Image Processing and Integrated Computing at the University of California in 2001. It was originally hosted [here](http://interface.cipic.ucdavis.edu/) and then later [here](https://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/cipic/spatial-sound/hrtf-data/). At the time of writing (15th of September 2022) both of these sites are down. I happened to have a local copy so I have decided to reupload the database here, as permitted by the license.

The material contained in this repository has not been altered in any way by me, except for the addition of this readme to explain the situation.

More information on the specifics of the data itself can be found in the original readme, [read\_me.txt](read_me.txt).
